Mapping Militant Organizations
==============================
This research project traces the evolution of militant organizations and the interactions that develop between them over time. Findings are presented in interactive "maps," which provide both (1) visual representations of how relationships among militant organizations change over time and (2) links to in-depth profiles of individual groups. The project provides uniquely accessible and clear genealogical information about violent extremist organizations that, combined with the detailed group profiles, is an invaluable resource to students, scholars, journalists, policy analysts, and other interested in violent oppositional organizations.

This repository contains the code used to power our interactive network diagrams and profiles (available at [mappingmilitants.stanford.edu](http://mappingmilitants.stanford.edu)). However, this repository does not contain (and the license herein does not apply to) the text of the profiles or the information stored in our databases.
